# Spack-Composer Design v1

## Purpose

`spack-composer` is the central stack-side tool described in the v6 design
notes (`docs/spack_stack_generation_design_v6.md`). It is the *replacement* for
the ad-hoc tooling layer that grew up inside `cse-stack`. The stack content
(profiles, stacks, templates, package sets, package repos) remains
human-authored YAML and Jinja; `spack-composer` operates on that content
and produces Spack-consumable workspaces, validation reports, scaffolded
template stubs, and finalized release manifests.

It is the **non-helper** of the v6 model: unlike `cluster-inspector` or
Ansible, the typical end-to-end flow goes through `spack-composer`. The
"manual workflow" remains executable (a human can write `spack.yaml` and run
`spack install` by hand), but the supported path is `spack-composer
render` → Spack → `spack-composer publish-manifest`.

## Document Set

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `spack_stack_generation_design_v6.md` § Render Step — Specification | The render seam contract: inputs, outputs, invariants, and the render pseudo-code. Authoritative for what a rendered workspace must look like. |
| `spack_composer_design_v1.md` (this document) | Product boundary, language and repo decisions, command catalog with per-command algorithm sketches, repository shape, packaging plan, and implementation phases. |

When the two disagree, the v6 render seam wins for the *render* command's
contract (`render` is a seam that every implementer reads). This document
wins for everything else: the other six commands, the repo shape, the
language, the packaging plan, the phases.

## Product Boundary

`spack-composer` is a content-to-Spack-workspace pipeline plus a set of
maintainer-facing analysis commands. Its CLI is the supported entry point
for stack operations.

| Boundary | Decision |
|---|---|
| Primary artifact | A rendered Spack workspace at `<output-root>/<system>/<stack>/<release>/`. |
| Primary consumer | Spack itself, on a build host; downstream Ansible playbooks for distribution. |
| Primary command | `spack-composer render`. |
| Durable inputs | `systems/<system>/profile.yaml`, `stacks/<stack>/stack.yaml`, `templates/<set>/...`, optional `package-sets/<name>.yaml`, optional `package-repos/<name>/`. |
| Durable outputs | Rendered workspace tree + `release-manifest.yaml`. The manifest is rewritten in place by `publish-manifest` to add build-context fields. |
| Diagnostics | Coverage reports, validate reports, explain menus, scaffold proposals. Written only when commanded; never co-mingled with the rendered workspace. |
| Source of truth | The stack repository. `spack-composer` does not invent stack content. |

## Relationship To `cse-stack`

`cse-stack` is being replaced by the generic, content-driven model where
`spack-composer` provides the tooling and `cse-stack` becomes one
*content corpus* among others. The relationship is:

- `cse-stack` is a downstream consumer / test fixture.
- Patterns proven in `cse-stack` are evaluated for promotion into the
  generic model (`templates/`, contract resolver rules, manifest fields).
- Patterns that do not promote stay in `cse-stack` until they either prove
  themselves or are discarded.
- `spack-composer` must not encode `cse-stack`-specific assumptions.
  Whatever it learns about packaging, lane composition, or manifest
  shape must be expressible through the generic stack inputs.

This means `cse-stack` is also the most useful early test surface for
`spack-composer`. The phase plan below (§Implementation Plan) treats
`cse-stack` fixtures as Phase 4 acceptance evidence, not Phase 1.

## Non-Goals

These are *not* `spack-composer`'s job:

- **No host probing.** `spack-composer` does not call `module avail`,
  read `/etc/os-release`, or otherwise inspect the host. System facts come
  from `profile.yaml`. The producer of that file is `cluster-inspector` or
  a human; see the inspector design docs.
- **No Spack calls in `render`.** The render step does not run `spack
  concretize`, `spack spec`, or `spack install`. Spack may be installed on
  the same host, but the renderer does not depend on it.
  (`validate-template-set` is the one command that *may* invoke Spack as
  an optional Phase 2 acceptance check; the render contract itself
  remains Spack-free.)
- **No deploy.** `spack-composer` does not `rsync`, `scp`, or otherwise
  distribute a rendered workspace to a build host. Distribution is
  Ansible's job (or a human's `rsync`).
- **No promotion.** `spack-composer` does not swap a `current` symlink,
  push to a release tree, or sign off on a release. The `publish-manifest`
  command rewrites the manifest in place; promotion gating lives in
  Ansible or human review.
- **No build orchestration.** `spack-composer` does not loop over lanes,
  submit `srun` jobs, or push to buildcaches. Those operations live in
  Ansible (or a human running `spack install`).
- **No template policy.** `scaffold-templates` proposes; the maintainer
  decides what becomes a committed template set. `spack-composer` will
  never overwrite an existing template scope or contract without the
  operator explicitly redirecting `--output` at that path.
- **No package decisions.** Which packages get built is `stack.yaml` intent.
  `spack-composer` resolves intent against the contract and profile; it
  does not pick package roots.

## Runtime Distribution

`spack-composer` is built on a Python-capable host (developer laptop or
the existing CSE environment on the HPC) and shipped as a single
self-contained artifact. Both spack-composer and cluster-inspector end
up as one-file deployments — they get there by different mechanisms,
but the operational property at the target is the same.

| Concern | spack-composer | cluster-inspector |
|---|---|---|
| Build host | Developer laptop or the CSE env on the HPC. Either works; both have Python and package access. | Developer laptop with Go toolchain. |
| Runtime artifact | A single shiv-built `.pyz` (`spack-composer.pyz`) plus the `spack-build` companion script, shipped together in a release tarball. | A single Go binary. |
| Distribution to target | `scp` the release tarball, `tar xzf`, run the `.pyz` directly. No `pip install` on the target. | `scp` the binary; run it. |
| Self-contained | Runtime deps (PyYAML, Jinja2, MarkupSafe, fastjsonschema, click, and any others on the committed surface) are bundled inside the `.pyz`. The target needs only Python 3.9. | Resource files embedded in the Go binary via `embed`. The target needs nothing. |
| Network | None required at runtime. None required at install time on the target. | None required at runtime. |
| Spack required | No (`render` and `validate` never call Spack). Optional for `validate-template-set` Phase 2. | No. |

The package must not read schema or template-base files from a source
checkout. After build, the only runtime inputs are command-line
arguments, the stack repository the operator points at, and resource
files embedded in the `.pyz` and loaded via `importlib.resources`.

## Implementation Language Decision

The implementation language is **Python**.

Rationale:

- The Spack ecosystem itself is Python. Stack maintainers reading
  templates, contract resolver rules, and packages.yaml fragments already
  read Python.
- Jinja2 is the canonical templating engine in Python and is the natural
  fit for the `templates/<set>/configs/...` and `environments/...` tree.
  Go's `text/template` is less ergonomic for the macro-heavy templates a
  real template set uses.
- Schema validation libraries are mature and ergonomic for the layered
  YAML the renderer consumes. `fastjsonschema` validates against the
  canonical JSON Schemas in `schemas/`; typed access is via plain
  `dataclasses` or `pydantic` (decision deferred to Phase 1, see Open
  Questions — the choice affects the `.pyz` platform matrix).
- `spack-composer` is built on a Python-capable host and shipped to the
  target as a self-contained `.pyz` produced by `shiv`. The
  one-file-on-target property that decided Go for the inspector is
  preserved for the composer through a different mechanism: shiv bundles
  the source plus every runtime dependency wheel into a single executable
  zipapp, so the target needs only a stdlib Python 3.9 to run it.
- A Python tool is easier to extend from a maintainer who already maintains
  a `package.py` recipe than a Go tool would be.

Stack maintainers do not need to know Go to maintain templates, but they
will routinely read and occasionally extend `spack-composer`. Choosing
Python keeps that path open. The self-containment constraint is met at
release time (via shiv), not at language choice — both tools satisfy the
same "one file lands on the target" property by different means.

## Relationship To The Stack Design

The stack design separates concerns sharply:

| File | Owner | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `profile.yaml` | System owner / `cluster-inspector` | Observed platform facts. |
| `stack.yaml` | Stack owner (package manager) | Desired stack behavior and root specs. |
| `templates/<set>/contract.yaml` | Framework/template owner | Vocabulary and resolver semantics. |
| `templates/<set>/stack-defaults.yaml` | Framework/template owner | Defaults for modules, externals, buildcache, release policy. |
| `templates/<set>/configs/...`, `templates/<set>/environments/...` | Framework/template owner | Jinja template tree the renderer expands. |
| `package-sets/<name>.yaml` | Stack owner | Optional reusable root spec lists. |
| `package-repos/<name>/` | Stack owner | Internal Spack package recipes. |

`spack-composer` works *only* on these files plus release variables passed
on the command line. It does not infer stack intent from system facts (that
would re-introduce the inspector/composer coupling v6 is designed to
prevent), and it does not write into any of the above paths during normal
operation. `scaffold-templates` is the one command that writes Jinja and
contract content, and it writes to a separate proposed-output path under
operator control.

## Command Set

Seven first-class commands, grouped by audience:

| Command | Audience | Writes to | Calls Spack? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `spack-composer assess-profiles` | maintainer | `--output` report file | No |
| `spack-composer scaffold-templates` | maintainer | `--output` proposed-template directory | No |
| `spack-composer validate-template-set` | maintainer / CI | `--output` report directory | Optional |
| `spack-composer explain` | package manager | stdout | No |
| `spack-composer render` | package manager / CI | `--output-root/<sys>/<stack>/<release>/` | No |
| `spack-composer validate` | package manager / CI | stdout (or `--report`) | No |
| `spack-composer publish-manifest` | CI / package manager | rewrites `release-manifest.yaml` in place | No |

The render seam is the only command whose contract lives in v6. Every
other command's contract lives in this document (the per-command
specifications below).

## Per-Command Specifications

Each subsection covers: purpose, audience, inputs, outputs, algorithm
sketch, invariants, and an example invocation.

### `spack-composer assess-profiles`

**Purpose.** Read a corpus of profiles and report which template sets cover
which systems. Identify coverage gaps before changing templates.

**Audience.** Maintainer.

**Inputs.**

- `--profiles <glob>` — one or more `profile.yaml` paths. Required.
- `--templates <dir>` — root of one or more template sets. Required.
- `--output <path>` — report YAML; defaults to stdout when omitted.

**Outputs.** A coverage report (YAML) plus a human summary on stderr. No
writes to stack source.

**Algorithm sketch.**

```text
function assess_profiles(profiles_glob, templates_dir, output_path):
    profiles = [load_profile(p) for p in expand(profiles_glob)]
    template_sets = enumerate_template_sets(templates_dir)
    matrix = {}
    for ts in template_sets:
        contract = load_contract(ts)
        defaults = load_defaults(ts)
        for profile in profiles:
            row = matrix.setdefault(ts.name, {})
            try:
                resolved = dry_resolve(profile, contract, defaults)
                row[profile.system.name] = {
                    "covered": True,
                    "lane_count": len(resolved.lanes),
                    "lane_kinds": resolved.lane_kinds,
                }
            except ResolutionFailure as e:
                row[profile.system.name] = {
                    "covered": False,
                    "missing_facts": e.missing_facts,
                    "blocked_toolchains": e.blocked_toolchains,
                }
    write_report(output_path, matrix, gaps=derive_gaps(matrix))
```

`dry_resolve` is a thin wrapper around the parts of the renderer that
resolve `build_class`, `toolchain`, and `nodes` against the contract and
profile, *without* expanding any Jinja templates or writing a workspace.

**Invariants.**

- Read-only on the stack source. The report is the only output.
- Deterministic for a fixed profile corpus and template tree.
- Never fails the run because one profile failed to resolve; failures are
  data in the report, not crashes.

**Example.**

```bash
spack-composer assess-profiles \
  --profiles 'systems/*/profile.yaml' \
  --templates templates \
  --output reports/coverage-2026.06.yaml
```

### `spack-composer scaffold-templates`

**Purpose.** Propose template/contract stubs that would extend coverage to
a profile not yet supported by any existing template set.

**Audience.** Maintainer.

**Inputs.**

- `--profile <path>` — one `profile.yaml`. Required.
- `--seed <template-set-dir>` — optional starter template set to use as
  the structural baseline. Defaults to a bundled starter shipped in the
  package's resource files.
- `--output <dir>` — directory the proposed templates will be written to.
  Required, must not exist or must be empty.
- `--stack-kind <library|application>` — picks which starter shape is used
  when `--seed` is not supplied. Defaults to `library`.

**Outputs.** A proposed-template directory containing draft `contract.yaml`,
draft `stack-defaults.yaml`, draft `configs/<scope>/...` files, and draft
`environments/<lane-kind>/spack.yaml.j2` files. Every file carries TODO
comments at the points where a human must make a real decision.

**Algorithm sketch.**

```text
function scaffold_templates(profile_path, seed_dir, output_dir, stack_kind):
    profile = load_profile(profile_path)
    seed = seed_dir or builtin_starter(stack_kind)
    require(output_dir.is_empty(),
            "scaffold output dir must not contain existing templates")

    facts = summarize_profile_facts(profile)
    # facts.compilers, facts.mpi_providers, facts.gpu_arches, facts.fabric,
    # facts.os, facts.cpu_targets, facts.vendor_cray (bool)

    scopes_to_emit = []
    scopes_to_emit += os_scopes(facts.os)
    scopes_to_emit += target_scopes(facts.cpu_targets)
    if facts.vendor_cray:
        scopes_to_emit += vendor_cray_scopes(facts)
    else:
        scopes_to_emit += vendor_generic_scopes(facts)
    scopes_to_emit += mpi_scopes(facts.mpi_providers)
    scopes_to_emit += gpu_scopes(facts.gpu_arches)

    for scope in scopes_to_emit:
        emit_scope_stub(output_dir / "configs" / scope.path,
                        seed_scope_template(seed, scope), facts)

    emit_contract_stub(output_dir / "contract.yaml",
                       facts, scopes_to_emit, seed_contract(seed))
    emit_defaults_stub(output_dir / "stack-defaults.yaml",
                       facts, scopes_to_emit, seed_defaults(seed))

    for lane_kind in lane_kinds_for_profile(profile):
        emit_env_stub(output_dir / "environments" / lane_kind / "spack.yaml.j2",
                      seed_env(seed, lane_kind), facts)

    write_review_checklist(output_dir / "REVIEW.md", facts, scopes_to_emit)
```

**Invariants.**

- Never writes outside `--output`. Never modifies an existing template set.
- Every file has at least one `# TODO` marker. The maintainer is expected
  to walk the tree and make decisions before promoting.
- `REVIEW.md` is the operator's checklist: which scope decisions are
  load-bearing, what defaults were guessed, what was left blank.
- Re-running with the same inputs produces byte-identical output.

**Example.**

```bash
spack-composer scaffold-templates \
  --profile systems/new-site/profile.yaml \
  --seed templates/v6 \
  --output proposed-templates/new-site \
  --stack-kind library
```

### `spack-composer validate-template-set`

**Purpose.** Render smoke stacks across a profile corpus to prove a
template set covers known systems. Catches breakage in CI before a
template change reaches a release.

**Audience.** Maintainer, CI.

**Inputs.**

- `--templates <dir>` — single template set under test. Required.
- `--profiles <glob>` — profiles to test against. Required.
- `--smoke-stack <path>` — a small `stack.yaml` that exercises the template
  set's core lane kinds. Required.
- `--concretize` — optional flag. When set, attempt `spack -e <env>
  concretize` on each rendered lane. Requires Spack on `PATH`.
- `--output <dir>` — directory of per-profile reports.

**Outputs.** Per-profile reports under `--output/<profile>/`:
`render.log`, optional `concretize.log`, and a summary `result.yaml`.
A roll-up `summary.yaml` at the output root.

**Algorithm sketch.**

```text
function validate_template_set(templates_dir, profiles_glob, smoke_stack,
                                concretize, output_dir):
    summary = []
    for profile_path in expand(profiles_glob):
        report_dir = output_dir / slug(profile_path)
        mkdir(report_dir)
        try:
            workspace = render(profile_path, smoke_stack,
                               templates_dir=templates_dir,
                               output_dir=report_dir / "workspace",
                               release_vars=smoke_release_vars())
            result = {"render": "ok", "workspace": str(workspace)}
            if concretize:
                conc = try_concretize_all_lanes(workspace)
                result["concretize"] = conc.status
                result["lane_results"] = conc.lane_results
        except RenderFailure as e:
            result = {"render": "fail", "reason_code": e.code,
                      "reason": str(e)}
        write_yaml(report_dir / "result.yaml", result)
        summary.append({"profile": profile_path, **result})
    write_yaml(output_dir / "summary.yaml", summary)
```

**Invariants.**

- Renders for *every* profile, even after one fails. Aggregates results.
- Failures are reported, not raised. Exit code reflects whether any
  profile failed.
- When `--concretize` is set, Spack version is recorded in the summary
  for reproducibility.
- Writes only under `--output`.

**Example.**

```bash
spack-composer validate-template-set \
  --templates templates/v6 \
  --profiles 'systems/*/profile.yaml' \
  --smoke-stack stacks/_smoke/stack.yaml \
  --concretize \
  --output reports/template-validation/v6
```

### `spack-composer explain`

**Purpose.** Print valid `class`, `toolchain`, `nodes`, GPU arch, and
`per_system` narrowing values for one (stack, template-set, profile)
triple. Helps the package manager author a `stack.yaml` without reading
the contract source.

**Audience.** Package manager.

**Inputs.**

- `--profile <path>` — required.
- `--stack <path>` — required when explaining a specific stack; if omitted,
  explains the contract's full vocabulary against the profile.
- `--template-set <dir>` — required when `--stack` does not pin
  `templates.set`; otherwise resolved from the stack.
- `--format <human|yaml>` — defaults to human.

**Outputs.** stdout.

**Algorithm sketch.**

```text
function explain(profile_path, stack_path, template_set_dir, format):
    profile = load_profile(profile_path)
    stack = load_stack(stack_path) if stack_path else None
    contract = load_contract(template_set_dir or stack.templates.set)
    facts = summarize_profile_facts(profile)

    valid = {
        "build_classes":   contract.build_classes.keys(),
        "toolchains":      filter_resolvable(contract.toolchains, facts),
        "node_selectors":  filter_resolvable(contract.node_selectors,
                                              facts.node_types),
        "gpu_arches":      facts.gpu_arches,
        "compilers":       facts.compiler_names,
        "mpi_providers":   facts.mpi_provider_names,
    }
    if stack:
        valid["per_system_narrowing"] = compute_narrowing_menu(stack, contract, facts)

    render_output(format, valid)
```

**Invariants.**

- Read-only.
- Deterministic.
- Filters every menu by what the profile can actually resolve; a compiler
  the contract knows about but the profile lacks does not appear.

**Example.**

```bash
spack-composer explain \
  --profile systems/example-cray/profile.yaml \
  --stack stacks/cse/stack.yaml
```

### `spack-composer render`

**Purpose.** Produce a runnable Spack workspace from a profile, stack,
template set, optional package sets, and optional package repos.

**Audience.** Package manager, CI.

**Contract.** The render command's full spec — inputs, outputs, invariants,
pseudo-code — lives in v6 § Render Step — Specification. This is the seam
contract that every implementer reads. This document does not duplicate
it.

**Notes specific to the Python implementation.**

- The render function corresponds to the v6 `render()` pseudo-code
  literally. Each top-level section in the pseudo-code (`Inputs`,
  `Context`, `Workspace skeleton`, `Config scopes`, `Lane environments`,
  `Release manifest`, `Commit`) maps to a function in the
  implementation.
- The Jinja environment is constructed once per render and is sandboxed:
  no `os.system`, no filesystem reads outside `templates/<set>/`, no
  network. The template context is the frozen `ctx` dict from the
  pseudo-code; templates may read its keys but cannot extend it.
- Schema validation runs against the JSON Schemas under
  `spack_composer/schemas/` via `fastjsonschema`. Typed access is via a
  per-input model class (profile, stack, package set, contract,
  defaults, manifest); whether those are `dataclasses` or pydantic
  models is a Phase 1 decision (see Open Questions).
- Determinism: YAML output uses a stable dumper (sorted keys at the
  per-block level chosen for review, not insertion order); template
  rendering never calls `time.time()` or `random`. Release timestamps are
  release-variable inputs, never wall-clock reads.

### `spack-composer validate`

**Purpose.** Run the render-step's pre-render checks without writing a
workspace. Used in CI on every stack-source PR and by package managers
before committing a `stack.yaml` change.

**Audience.** Package manager, CI.

**Inputs.**

- `--profile <path>` — required.
- `--stack <path>` — required.
- `--templates <dir>` — required.
- `--package-sets <dir>` — optional; defaults to `package-sets/` relative to stack.
- `--package-repos <dir>` — optional; defaults to `package-repos/` relative to stack.
- `--report <path>` — optional YAML report; defaults to stdout summary.

**Outputs.** A pass/fail summary on stdout (or stderr) plus optional
YAML report. Exit code 0 on pass, non-zero on any fail.

**Algorithm sketch.**

```text
function validate(profile_path, stack_path, templates_dir,
                  package_sets_dir, package_repos_dir, report_path):
    issues = []

    profile = load_yaml(profile_path)
    issues += validate_schema(profile, "profile.v1")
    raw_stack = load_yaml(stack_path)
    issues += validate_schema(raw_stack, "stack.v1")

    template_set = templates_dir / raw_stack.templates.set
    defaults = load_yaml(template_set / "stack-defaults.yaml")
    issues += validate_schema(defaults, "stack_defaults.v1")
    contract = load_yaml(template_set / "contract.yaml")
    issues += validate_schema(contract, "template_contract.v1")

    stack = merge_defaults(defaults, raw_stack)
    issues += cross_check_profile_contract(profile, stack)
    issues += validate_builds_against_contract(stack, contract)
    issues += validate_package_sets(stack, package_sets_dir, contract)
    issues += validate_package_repositories(stack, defaults, package_repos_dir)
    issues += validate_per_system_narrowing(stack, profile, contract)

    write_report(report_path, issues)
    return 0 if not issues.has_errors() else 1
```

Every check is one the renderer would have run before writing the
workspace. `validate` is the renderer with the writes removed.

**Invariants.**

- Read-only. Never writes inside the stack source. The only file write is
  the optional `--report`.
- The validation checks are *the same* checks the renderer applies; a
  pass here guarantees the renderer's pre-render validation will pass.
- Includes the `per_system` validation: every name in the matching
  `per_system.<system>` block must resolve in the profile or contract.

**Example.**

```bash
spack-composer validate \
  --profile systems/example-cray/profile.yaml \
  --stack stacks/cse/stack.yaml \
  --templates templates \
  --report reports/validate-cse-cray.yaml
```

### `spack-composer publish-manifest`

**Purpose.** Rewrite a draft `release-manifest.yaml` to `phase: final`
after build, verification, and buildcache push. Captures build-context
fields the renderer could not know.

**Audience.** CI, package manager.

**Inputs.**

- `--workspace <dir>` — the rendered workspace whose manifest is being
  finalized. Required.
- `--build-host <hostname>` — required.
- `--lockfiles <dir>` — directory of `spack.lock` files per lane; required.
  The lockfile path layout matches `environments/<compiler>/<lane>/spack.lock`.
- `--platform-module-prereqs <file>` — YAML listing platform-module
  prerequisites per lane (the modules the package modules' `prereq` lines
  will name). Required for stacks that declare site-external lanes.
- `--buildcache-destinations <file>` — YAML listing mirrors the build was
  actually pushed to. Required when `stack.yaml.buildcache.policy` requires push.
- `--verify-results <file>` — YAML with smoke, ldd, manifest-verify
  results per lane. Required.
- `--force` — optional; rewrite a manifest already in `phase: final`.

**Outputs.** Rewrites `<workspace>/release-manifest.yaml` in place,
atomic-replace. Setting `phase: final`. Returns the workspace path.

**Algorithm sketch.**

```text

    manifest.verification = load_yaml(verify_results_path)

    manifest.phase = "final"
    atomic_write_yaml(manifest_path, manifest)
    return workspace
```

**Invariants.**

- Idempotent (modulo `--force`): a final manifest is not rewritten without
  the operator opting in.
- The renderer-derived fields (`source-derived`, `templates`,
  `applied_narrowing`, `skipped_builds`, `lanes[*].skeleton`) are *not*
  modified by this command. Only fields explicitly marked "build-context"
  in the manifest schema are added.
- The provenance summary per lane (`Stack-built / Platform-backed /
  Site-external / Spack-built` counts) is derived here from the lockfile
  plus contract; the renderer must not pre-label provenance.
- Atomic write: the manifest is fully written to a side path and renamed.
- The `built_at` timestamp comes from a release variable (the caller's
  intent) or the caller's clock; never from `spack-composer`'s own clock
  without the caller asking for it. Reruns of `publish-manifest` with
  the same inputs are not expected to be byte-identical (timestamps and
  build host are observed at finalize time), but the rest of the manifest
  is.

**Example.**

```bash
spack-composer publish-manifest \
  --workspace /shared/stack/work/example-cray/cse/2026.06 \
  --build-host cray01 \
  --lockfiles /shared/stack/work/example-cray/cse/2026.06/environments \
  --platform-module-prereqs reports/prereqs.yaml \
  --buildcache-destinations reports/buildcache-push.yaml \
  --verify-results reports/verify.yaml
```

## Companion Script: `spack-build`

`spack-build` is a standalone shell script shipped in the `spack-composer`
package and installed onto `$PATH` by the wheel. It is the supported way to
drive Spack from a rendered workspace for sites that do not run Ansible,
for laptop-side testing, and for CI smoke runs. Ansible may either call
`spack-build` per host or replicate its logic; either is fine.

### Why a shell script, not a Python subcommand

The build half is a sequence of `spack` invocations plus a few `ldd` and
`spack verify` calls. Re-implementing that in Python adds layers without
value, and sites *will* customize parallelism, partition selection, and
retries on flaky fabric. A short bash script is easier to fork than a Python
subcommand, and it keeps `spack-composer`'s Python tool focused on YAML
transforms (render, validate, publish-manifest). The split mirrors the
render/build separation: `spack-composer` knows nothing about Spack
invocation; `spack-build` knows nothing about template rendering.

### Inputs

| Argument | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--workspace <dir>` | Required. The rendered workspace produced by `spack-composer render`. |
| `--spack-root <dir>` | Optional. Path to a Spack checkout. The script sources `<dir>/share/spack/setup-env.sh` before any work. If omitted, `spack` must already be on `$PATH` (typical when a site module provides it). |
| `--lanes <glob>` | Optional. Lane filter, e.g. `gcc/*` or `gcc/mpi-craympich`. Defaults to all lanes in the workspace. |
| `--reports <dir>` | Optional. Where to write per-lane reports and the manifest-feed YAML files. Defaults to `<workspace>/reports/`. |
| `--jobs <n>` | Optional. `spack install -j <n>` parallelism. Defaults to half the host's CPU count. |
| `--skip-push` | Optional. Skip the buildcache push step (useful for laptop test runs). |
| `--fail-fast` | Optional. Exit on the first lane failure instead of continuing through all lanes. Default is continue-and-report. |

### Pre-flight: Spack version check

Before any lane runs, the script:

1. Sources `<spack-root>/share/spack/setup-env.sh` if `--spack-root` is
   given; otherwise relies on `$PATH`.
2. Reads `templates/<set>/stack-defaults.yaml.spack.floor` from the
   rendered workspace (the floor is mandatory in the template defaults).
3. Reads `stack.yaml.spack.version` from the rendered workspace (the pin
   is optional and may tighten but never widen the floor).
4. Runs `spack --version` and compares against floor + pin.
5. On mismatch, exits non-zero with a clear message naming the floor, the
   pin (if any), the discovered version, and the install path. No lane
   work begins.

The Spack version actually used is captured into `verify-results.yaml` so
`publish-manifest` can write it into `release-manifest.yaml.build_context.spack_version`.

See v6 §Spack Version Floor for the three-layer version model
(floor / pin / root) and the recommended multi-version on-disk layout.

### Per-lane flow

For each lane the script does, in order:

1. `spack -e <env> concretize --force` → writes `spack.lock`.
2. `spack -e <env> fetch -D` → populates `source_cache` from internet or
   from a source mirror declared in `configs/common/mirrors.yaml`. See v6
   §Source Cold-Start On A New Or Air-Gapped Site for the three supported
   patterns (build host has internet, login-node prefetch, fully
   air-gapped via `spack mirror create`).
3. `spack -e <env> install -j <n>` → installs every spec in the lock.
4. Smoke test: for each entry in `stack.yaml.smoke[*]` (when present in
   the rendered workspace's effective stack), `spack -e <env> load <spec>
   && <smoke_command>`.
5. `ldd` walk over installed binaries — drift detector, not a deploy gate.
6. `spack -e <env> verify --files` — cross-check installed files against
   the manifest.
7. `spack -e <env> buildcache push <mirror>` per buildcache mirror declared
   in the workspace's `configs/common/mirrors.yaml` (skipped under
   `--skip-push`).

Each step's stdout/stderr is captured to `<reports>/<lane>/<step>.log`. A
per-lane `result.yaml` records pass/fail and timings.

### Output artifacts

The script writes three roll-up files under `<reports>/` whose shapes
match what `spack-composer publish-manifest` consumes:

| File | Format | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `verify-results.yaml` | per-lane pass/fail for concretize, install, smoke, ldd, manifest-verify | `publish-manifest --verify-results` |
| `buildcache-destinations.yaml` | per-lane list of mirrors actually pushed to | `publish-manifest --buildcache-destinations` |
| `platform-module-prereqs.yaml` | per-lane platform-module list, copied verbatim from each lane's `spack.yaml` `include::` resolution | `publish-manifest --platform-module-prereqs` |

The intent is that a caller can run `spack-build --workspace <ws>` and
then `spack-composer publish-manifest --workspace <ws> --build-host
$(hostname) --lockfiles <ws>/environments --verify-results
<ws>/reports/verify-results.yaml ...` without staging files by hand.

### Failure handling

- Default (no `--fail-fast`): run every lane, record per-lane failures,
  exit non-zero if any lane failed. The per-lane logs let the operator
  re-run individual lanes after fixing the cause.
- `--fail-fast`: exit on the first lane failure. Useful for CI on a
  small smoke stack where the first failure should kill the job.
- A lane failure does not stop later lanes from running unless
  `--fail-fast` is set; failed lanes are simply absent from the
  buildcache push step.

### Determinism

`spack-build` is **not** byte-deterministic on re-runs (timestamps, build
host, parallelism effects on log interleaving). Determinism is the
renderer's contract; the build half is observably non-deterministic by
nature. What it *is*: idempotent on success. Re-running on an already-built
workspace re-uses Spack's installed prefixes and skips work.

### Distribution

- Lives in the `spack-composer/` repo at `scripts/spack-build`.
- Ships alongside the `.pyz` inside the release tarball
  (`spack-composer-X.Y.Z.tar.gz`). On the target, the tarball extracts
  to a directory containing both `spack-composer.pyz` and `spack-build`;
  operators add that directory to `$PATH` once.
- The script's only runtime dependencies are `bash`, `spack`, and standard
  POSIX utilities (`awk`, `sed`, `find`, `ldd`). No Python is required to
  execute it — the script does not invoke `spack-composer.pyz`; it is
  the `.pyz`'s sibling, not a wrapper.
- The script is read-only on the rendered workspace except for
  `<workspace>/spack.lock` per lane (created by concretize),
  `<workspace>/.spack-env/` per lane (created by Spack), and the
  `<reports>/` tree it writes to.

### What `spack-build` does NOT do

- It does not render. The workspace is an input.
- It does not finalize the manifest. `spack-composer publish-manifest` is
  the next step.
- It does not promote the release (swap `current` symlink, copy to a
  release tree). That is Ansible's job, or a human's `rsync` + `ln -sfn`.
- It does not orchestrate across hosts. One invocation runs on one
  build host. Ansible (or a human) loops across hosts.

The Python package is `spack_composer`, the CLI entry point is
`spack-composer`. Resource files (schemas, starters, the third-party
manifest) are loaded with `importlib.resources`, so the installed `.pyz`
does not need to locate files relative to a source checkout. The
`THIRD_PARTY.toml` and `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES/` at the repo root are the
source of truth; `scripts/build-pyz.sh` copies them into
`src/spack_composer/resources/` immediately before the shiv step so the
runtime `.pyz` carries them.

## Packaging Plan

### Dev install

`pip install -e .[dev]` from a checkout. Pulls runtime deps plus dev
extras (pytest, ruff, shiv, build). Requires internet at dev time.

### Release build

A single script produces the release tarball:

```bash
cd spack-composer/
scripts/build-pyz.sh
# → dist/spack-composer-X.Y.Z.tar.gz containing:
#     spack-composer.pyz        (shiv-built single-file Python artifact)
#     spack-build               (companion shell script)
#     README                    (3-line install / run instructions)
#     LICENSE                   (spack-composer's own license)
#     THIRD_PARTY.toml          (bundled-deps manifest)
#     THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES/     (full license text per bundled dep)
```

The build host may be a developer laptop or the CSE env on the HPC —
both work, because both have Python and package access. The script:

1. Resolves the runtime dep set against `pyproject.toml`.
2. Runs `scripts/generate-third-party.py` to refresh `THIRD_PARTY.toml`
   and `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES/`. Fails if any dep is missing from the
   manifest or carries a license outside the allowlist (see §License
   Compliance).
3. Copies `THIRD_PARTY.toml` and `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES/` into
   `src/spack_composer/resources/` so they ship inside the `.pyz`.
4. Builds the wheel (`python -m build --wheel`).
5. Builds the `.pyz` with `shiv -e spack_composer.cli:main -c
   spack-composer -p '/usr/bin/env python3' -o
   dist/spack-composer.pyz dist/spack_composer-*.whl`.
6. Packs `.pyz`, `spack-build`, `README`, `LICENSE`, `THIRD_PARTY.toml`,
   and `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES/` into the release tarball.

### Target install

```bash
scp dist/spack-composer-X.Y.Z.tar.gz user@target:/shared/stack/
ssh user@target 'cd /shared/stack && tar xzf spack-composer-X.Y.Z.tar.gz'
ssh user@target 'chmod +x /shared/stack/spack-composer-X.Y.Z/spack-composer.pyz'
ssh user@target '/shared/stack/spack-composer-X.Y.Z/spack-composer.pyz --help'
```

No `pip install` on the target. No internet on the target. No
third-party Python packages required on the target — only Python 3.9
stdlib.

### `pyproject.toml`

- `requires-python = ">=3.9"`
- `dependencies = [<committed surface>]` — see the §Runtime Distribution
  table for the canonical list (`PyYAML`, `Jinja2`, `MarkupSafe`,
  `fastjsonschema`, `click`; `pydantic` v2 conditional, see Open
  Questions).
- `[project.optional-dependencies] dev = ["pytest", "ruff", "shiv",
  "build", ...]`.
- `[project.scripts] spack-composer = "spack_composer.cli:main"`.
- License: `Apache-2.0` (recommendation; final confirmation in Phase 1).
- Build backend: `setuptools` (widely available; matches the
  clusterinspector precedent).

### Spack dependency

None. `spack-composer` neither imports Spack nor depends on a Spack
install. The optional `validate-template-set --concretize` shells out
to `spack` if found on `$PATH`; otherwise it skips the concretization
step.

### Network access at runtime

None. The `.pyz` runs entirely from the bundled wheels plus stdlib.

## License Compliance

The `.pyz` bundles other people's code. To redistribute it cleanly the
repo declares what is bundled, under what license, and the build
pipeline enforces that the license set is acceptable before producing
a release. The shipped `.pyz` carries the third-party license texts
alongside the code.

### Allowed licenses

The build pipeline accepts these SPDX identifiers by default:

- `MIT`
- `BSD-2-Clause`, `BSD-3-Clause`
- `Apache-2.0`
- `ISC`
- `Python-2.0` (PSF)
- `MPL-2.0` (case-by-case; flag for review)

Excluded by default — copyleft licenses that would create
redistribution friction:

- The GPL family (`GPL-2.0`, `GPL-3.0`, `AGPL-3.0`).
- LGPL is conditionally allowed only when dynamically linked, which is
  rare for Python deps; flag for review.

A license outside the allowlist that the team decides to ship anyway
requires a documented exemption entry inside `THIRD_PARTY.toml` with
the rationale.

### Source-of-truth manifest

`THIRD_PARTY.toml` at the repo root is authoritative. One entry per
runtime dependency:

```toml
[meta]
generated_by = "scripts/generate-third-party.py"
generated_at = "2026-06-17T18:00:00Z"

[[dependency]]
name = "PyYAML"
version = "6.0.3"
license_spdx = "MIT"
project_url = "https://pyyaml.org/"
source_url = "https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml"
license_file = "THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES/PyYAML.txt"
copyright = "Copyright (c) 2017-2024 Ingy döt Net; Copyright (c) 2006-2016 Kirill Simonov"
purpose = "YAML read/write"

[[dependency]]
name = "Jinja2"
version = "3.1.4"
license_spdx = "BSD-3-Clause"
project_url = "https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/"
source_url = "https://github.com/pallets/jinja"
license_file = "THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES/Jinja2.txt"
copyright = "Copyright 2007 Pallets"
purpose = "Template rendering"

# ... one block per runtime dep
```

`THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES/<name>.txt` is the unmodified license text
extracted from each bundled wheel's `LICENSE` / `LICENSE.txt` /
`LICENSE.rst`. Never hand-edited.

### Build-time enforcement

`scripts/generate-third-party.py` is the single tool that maintains
both files. It:

1. Resolves `pyproject.toml`'s runtime deps to a concrete wheel set.
2. Inspects each wheel's metadata for name, version, and license.
3. Cross-checks against `THIRD_PARTY.toml`:
   - Refuses to continue if a resolved dep is missing from the
     manifest, or vice versa.
   - Refuses to continue if any license falls outside the allowlist
     and has no documented exemption.
4. Refreshes `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES/<name>.txt` from each wheel's
   `LICENSE` file.
5. Rewrites `THIRD_PARTY.toml` with the regenerated entries.

`scripts/build-pyz.sh` runs this script as its first step and aborts
the release if the manifest is out of sync or any license is
unapproved.

CI runs the same script on every PR and fails the build when
`pyproject.toml` changes a runtime dep without a matching
`THIRD_PARTY.toml` update.

### What ships inside the `.pyz`

The runtime artifact contains:

- spack-composer source.
- All bundled runtime dep wheels (resolved by shiv at build time).
- `LICENSE` (spack-composer's own).
- `THIRD_PARTY.toml`.
- `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES/` directory.

### `spack-composer --licenses`

A top-level CLI flag prints the bundled `THIRD_PARTY.toml` content.
Operators can audit what they're running without unpacking the `.pyz`:

```bash
$ spack-composer --licenses
spack-composer X.Y.Z
Apache-2.0

Bundled runtime dependencies:
  PyYAML        6.0.3   MIT          (YAML read/write)
  Jinja2        3.1.4   BSD-3-Clause (Template rendering)
  MarkupSafe    2.1.5   BSD-3-Clause (Jinja2 dependency)
  fastjsonschema 2.20.0 BSD-3-Clause (JSON Schema validation)
  click         8.1.7   BSD-3-Clause (CLI dispatch)

Full license texts ship inside the .pyz at
  spack_composer/resources/THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES/
```

This makes compliance review possible without filesystem
archaeology.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 — Skeleton + Render Seam + Release Build

- Create the `spack-composer/` repo with the layout above.
- Author the initial `THIRD_PARTY.toml` and `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES/`
  for the committed runtime dep surface.
- Author `scripts/generate-third-party.py` and `scripts/build-pyz.sh`.
- Decide pydantic-v2 vs. dataclasses + fastjsonschema (see Open
  Questions). The decision affects the .pyz platform matrix.
- Confirm `spack-composer`'s own license (Apache-2.0 is the
  recommendation).
- Implement `cli.py` with all seven subcommand stubs returning "not yet
  implemented" except `render`, plus the `--licenses` top-level flag.
- Implement the schema models from the JSON schemas under `schemas/`.
- Implement `render` against the v6 pseudo-code, using the deterministic
  YAML dumper and Jinja2 environment described above.
- Implement `validate` as a re-use of the render pre-checks without
  the writes.

Acceptance:

- `spack-composer render` produces a byte-identical workspace for a fixed
  fixture set on two successive runs.
- `spack-composer validate` produces a report for the same inputs and
  catches every render-time validation failure listed in v6's render
  invariant table.
- `scripts/build-pyz.sh` produces `dist/spack-composer-X.Y.Z.tar.gz`
  from a clean checkout in one command.
- The shipped `.pyz` runs `spack-composer --help` on a vanilla Linux
  Python 3.9 host with no other tooling installed.
- `spack-composer --licenses` prints the bundled `THIRD_PARTY.toml`
  content.
- The build pipeline refuses to produce a release when
  `THIRD_PARTY.toml` is out of sync with `pyproject.toml` or when any
  bundled dep license is outside the allowlist without an exemption.

### Phase 2 — Maintainer Commands

- Implement `assess-profiles`: dry-resolve every (profile, template-set)
  pair, emit coverage report.
- Implement `explain`: filter contract vocabulary by profile-resolvable
  candidates.
- Implement `validate-template-set` (render-only mode). Add the
  `--concretize` flag last; treat Spack as optional.

Acceptance:

- `assess-profiles` correctly reports coverage for the fixture corpus
  including at least one profile with a deliberate gap (missing GPU
  toolkit, missing site MPI).
- `explain` agrees with what `render` would actually accept; there is a
  test that fuzzes `stack.yaml` against `explain`'s output and asserts
  render success/failure matches.
- `validate-template-set` exits non-zero when one profile fails to render
  against the template set and the failure is recorded in the summary.

### Phase 3 — Scaffold And Publish

- Implement `scaffold-templates` with the `library` and `application`
  starters bundled in `scaffold/starters/`.
- Implement `publish-manifest` against the v6 manifest schema, including
  provenance derivation from lockfiles.
- Implement the `spack-build` companion script and wire its output
  artifact shapes to `publish-manifest`'s input flags.

Acceptance:

- `scaffold-templates` produces a draft template set that, after the
  TODO comments are filled in, passes `validate-template-set` against
  the originating profile.
- `publish-manifest` rewrites a draft manifest to final and the result
  validates against `release-manifest-v1.json`.
- Re-running `publish-manifest` without `--force` on a final manifest
  exits non-zero with a clear message.
- `spack-build --workspace <rendered>` builds every lane of the
  smoke-stack fixture, emits `verify-results.yaml`,
  `buildcache-destinations.yaml`, and `platform-module-prereqs.yaml`,
  and those three files satisfy `publish-manifest`'s schema without
  hand editing.

### Phase 4 — `cse-stack` Acceptance

- Point `spack-composer` at the real `cse-stack` content. Render every
  documented stack against every documented profile.
- Use the resulting fixtures to drive `validate-template-set` in CI.
- Identify patterns in `cse-stack` that did not fit cleanly into the
  generic model and decide per-pattern: promote to templates, keep in
  `cse-stack`, or discard.

Acceptance:

- `cse-stack`'s end-to-end Cray flow (v6 § Example Cray Flow) reproduces
  through `spack-composer` without out-of-tree patches.
- `cse-stack`'s end-to-end Generic Linux HPC flow (v6 § Example Generic
  Linux HPC Flow) reproduces through `spack-composer` without
  out-of-tree patches.
- At least one `cse-stack` pattern is identified for promotion and at
  least one is identified for discard, with the decisions captured in
  follow-on commits to `templates/v6/` or to this design doc's Open
  Questions.

## Acceptance Criteria For v1

- All seven `spack-composer` commands implemented end-to-end, plus the
  `spack-build` companion script.
- `render` byte-deterministic for fixed inputs.
- `validate` agrees with `render`'s pre-flight check set: anything
  `render` would reject before writing, `validate` reports.
- `publish-manifest` rewrites the draft manifest to final and the
  result validates against the manifest schema.
- `assess-profiles` and `explain` filter strictly by profile-resolvable
  candidates; no candidate the renderer would reject ever appears in a
  positive menu.
- `scaffold-templates` proposes a template set that passes
  `validate-template-set` after the operator fills the TODOs.
- `validate-template-set` runs in CI on the fixture corpus on every PR.
- The release tarball is produced from a clean checkout in one command
  (`scripts/build-pyz.sh`).
- The shipped `.pyz` runs `spack-composer --help` on a vanilla Linux
  Python 3.9 host with no other tooling installed (no `pip install`,
  no internet).
- `spack-composer --licenses` prints the bundled `THIRD_PARTY.toml`
  manifest of runtime deps and their licenses.
- The build pipeline refuses to produce a release when
  `THIRD_PARTY.toml` is out of sync with `pyproject.toml` or when any
  bundled dep license is outside the allowlist without a documented
  exemption.
- `cse-stack`'s Cray and Generic Linux HPC end-to-end flows reproduce
  through `spack-composer`.

## Open Questions

- **Stable schema versions.** Each schema (profile, stack, contract,
  manifest, package-set) carries a `schema_version`. The bump policy is
  not specified yet — does a Phase 2 schema change require a tool major
  bump? Probably yes for breaking changes; defer to the first real bump.
- **pydantic vs. dataclasses for typed models.** Pydantic v2 has a
  Rust-compiled core; using it means the release `.pyz` is
  platform-specific (one build per target platform/Python ABI pair).
  Plain dataclasses + `fastjsonschema` validation keeps the `.pyz`
  universal across platforms. Phase 1 picks based on whether the typed-
  model ergonomics outweigh the platform-matrix cost.
- **Target platform matrix.** If deployment targets include non-x86_64
  architectures (ARM HPC nodes are appearing), either the release
  pipeline produces one `.pyz` per platform OR runtime deps are
  constrained to pure-Python only. Phase 1 records the actual target
  list and picks.
- **spack-composer's own license.** Apache-2.0 is the recommended
  default (permissive, attribution-friendly, common in HPC tooling).
  Phase 1 confirms; the choice is set in `pyproject.toml` and `LICENSE`.
- **Provenance derivation details.** `publish-manifest` derives the
  four-class provenance per spec from lockfile + profile + contract. The
  rules for "is this spec a Platform-backed external or a Site-external
  external?" are stated structurally in v6 but not as code-ready
  predicates. Resolve in Phase 3 when implementing the manifest
  finalize step.
- **Optional concretization in `validate-template-set`.** Should the
  concretize step take a Spack version pin so CI is reproducible across
  Spack upgrades? Likely yes; add `--spack-version` (advisory: refuses
  to run if `spack --version` does not match) in a Phase 2 follow-up.
- **Starter template sets.** The bundled `library` and `application`
  starters need to be designed. Phase 3 should resolve whether they are
  copies of `cse-stack`'s `templates/v6` and `templates/app-direct-v1`
  or simpler skeletons.
- **CI integration shape.** What does the recommended CI configuration
  look like for a stack repo that uses `spack-composer`? Out of scope
  for v1; document in a follow-on after the maintainer commands are
  real.
