# 11 — Complete profile first, then attribution

This is the primary experiment agreed for the standalone trial: build and qualify the complete supplied profile first, compare it with a matched reference, and investigate selected controls only afterward. ReFrame runs prebuilt artifacts inside operator-controlled Slurm allocations; this campaign is outside CI.

## 1. Build scope and sequence

The primary scope contains the **trial-owned** FFTW, serial/parallel HDF5, LAPACK plus its reference-implementation BLAS, Open MPI/its bundled dependencies, UCX, and benchmark callers. GCC 12.5, binutils, CMake, Python/ReFrame, the OS, Slurm, fabric drivers and approved site libraries stay fixed. This is not a rebuild of every library on the machine. Record those fixed dependencies as part of the experiment's boundary. From the documentation checkout, set `export TRIAL_PROCEDURE_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)` before the campaign; retain source checksums and actual compile/link commands with it.

| Stage | Builds and comparison | Question |
|---|---|---|
| Qualification | Full flags on each applicable language/output; upstream tests, artifact inspection and two-node transport checks | Did the proposed configuration build and work? |
| Primary screen | Matching full/reference callers, packages, BLAS and MPI/UCX; initial serial/threaded and 1/2-node cases | What is the combined performance effect of the supplied profile in this trial scope? |
| Package attribution | One full caller and full dependency stack; switch only the package library | Which package rebuild helps explain an observed change? |
| Control attribution | Full versus one independently removed control for a selected package/workload | What changes when this control is absent, with the other controls retained? |
| Extended follow-up | Selected MPI/UCX component rebuilds, 4/8-node cases or denser ranks | Does an unresolved effect depend on the communication stack or scale? |

The reference explicitly disables the variable controls; optimization, CPU target, PIC for shared libraries, warnings and non-executable stack stay fixed. `full` denotes all applicable controls in the recorded supplied list, not every GCC option or an independent certification of STIG compliance. The per-control hypotheses are in [08](08-slurm-campaign.md#1-hypotheses-and-comparisons). Write hypotheses before running; do not add removal percentages together.

**Build order:** 00 (reuse the GCC you finished) -> 01 (profiles/qualification/harness) -> 00b (full then reference UCX/Open MPI) -> 02/03/04 (packages and matching BLAS) -> 05 (matching parallel packages) -> 06 (ReFrame) -> this section's reference callers and guards -> 08 or 10. [12](12-osu-screen.md) adds a small OSU screen without a Cartesian product of MPI/package/flag variants. Do not build removal variants yet.

### If you are partway through a build

Pull the documentation into its separate checkout. A qualified, unchanged full GCC/MPI/package installation can be retained. Select only missing profiles in `MPI_VARIANTS`, `BLAS_VARIANTS` and the package arrays; the build guards intentionally reject existing directories. A partially configured directory is not a qualified installation. Preserve it and its logs, then choose a fresh build directory/prefix for a corrected configuration. Do not delete source/results or overwrite installed libraries while jobs are queued or running.

The older `blas-fixed` reference-only installation does not supply the full/reference numerical-stack experiment. Build `install/blas/full` and `install/blas/reference` using 04; verify which BLAS the existing LAPACK/caller actually loads before reuse. Rebuild a caller when its source, compile flags or intended dependency interface changes. Regenerate `profiles.sh`, `paired.py`, ReFrame definitions and campaign scripts from the updated procedures; pulling Markdown does not update generated files automatically.

### Compatibility decisions during the build

Use the qualification and `logs/compatibility.tsv` procedure in [01](01-common.md#2-qualify-flags-before-expensive-builds). Preserve the exact error and actual compiler/linker commands. A flag accepted but overridden by the build system requires a build fix. A required control rejected by the package requires a resolved configuration or an explicitly named, approved reduced profile and a new affected build; do not silently omit it. Update the procedure and build manifest before timing. Existing results retain their original identity.

Hardening GCC's own executables is a separate experiment. Applying hardening flags to a package does not require rebuilding GCC, and hardening the compiler process does not automatically enable hardening in the programs it emits.

## 2. Build reference callers

Run after the full callers and both library/dependency arms exist. These compile the **same sources and workloads** with reference executable flags. The primary comparison includes caller hardening as well as library hardening; later library scope retains the full caller. The MPI versions/headers/options are identical across arms. Both arms use RUNPATH, allowing the explicitly selected runtime libraries to take precedence; the loader checks below reject a substitution.

```bash
source "$TRIAL_ROOT/env.sh"
source "$TRIAL_ROOT/profiles.sh"
profile_flags reference
read -r -a cargs <<< "$EXE_CFLAGS"
read -r -a fargs <<< "$EXE_FFLAGS"

source "$TRIAL_ROOT/mpi-env.sh"
```

Inspect ELF, commands and loaded dependencies for both callers using 01. Full callers must have PIE/RELRO/NOW; reference callers must reflect the disabled controls. Upstream tools and MPI/UCX utilities need executable PIE qualification as well; a shared-library `-fPIC` setting alone is not that qualification. Retain any audit failure and resolve it before claiming the full installation satisfies the specified profile.

### Freeze a build inventory

After all qualification checks pass, create an inventory before timing. Regenerate it under a new filename after a documented rebuild; never edit a frozen experiment while its jobs are running.

```bash
python3 - <<'PYTHON'
import hashlib, json, os, pathlib
root=pathlib.Path(os.environ['TRIAL_ROOT'])
manifest=root/'logs/build-inventory.json'
if manifest.exists(): raise SystemExit('Inventory exists; retain it and use a new trial identity after a rebuild')
files={}
for base in (root/'install',root/'bench',root/'toolchains'):
    for path in sorted(base.rglob('*')):
        if path.is_file():
            files[str(path.relative_to(root))]=hashlib.sha256(path.read_bytes()).hexdigest()
manifest.write_text(json.dumps({'procedure_commit':os.environ.get('TRIAL_PROCEDURE_COMMIT',''),
                               'files_sha256':files},indent=2)+'\n')
PYTHON
```

## 3. Guard MPI dependencies on every rank

Generate this helper once. It runs before each timed MPI caller on each compute node. Its cost is included in whole-process time, symmetrically in both arms, and excluded from the caller's kernel timers. Report whole-process time as launch/loading/guards/workload/validation, not pure loader time. Matching launchers, selected package libraries and the UCX component are checked separately. The caller's MPI placement check remains active on every invocation.

```bash
cat > "$TRIAL_ROOT/bench/rank-exec.sh" <<'SH'
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
exe=${1:?executable}; shift
: "${TRIAL_MPI_PREFIX:?}" "${TRIAL_UCX_PREFIX:?}"
loaded=$(ldd "$exe")
component=$(ldd "$TRIAL_MPI_PREFIX/lib/openmpi/mca_pml_ucx.so")
export TRIAL_LOADED="$loaded" TRIAL_COMPONENT="$component"
python3 - <<'PY'
import os, re, socket
mpi,ucx=os.environ['TRIAL_MPI_PREFIX'],os.environ['TRIAL_UCX_PREFIX']
text=os.environ['TRIAL_LOADED']+'\n'+os.environ['TRIAL_COMPONENT']
if 'not found' in text: raise SystemExit('Missing rank dependency')
mpi_paths=re.findall(r'lib(?:mpi|open-rte|open-pal)\S*\s+=>\s+(\S+)',text)
ucx_paths=re.findall(r'lib(?:ucp|uct|ucs|ucm)\S*\s+=>\s+(\S+)',text)
if not mpi_paths or any(not p.startswith(mpi+'/lib/') for p in mpi_paths):
    raise SystemExit('Wrong MPI on rank')
if not ucx_paths or any(not p.startswith(ucx+'/lib/') for p in ucx_paths):
    raise SystemExit('Wrong UCX component dependencies on rank')
package=os.environ.get('TRIAL_LIBRARY_PREFIX','')
if package:
    family='libfftw3' if '/fftw' in package else 'libhdf5'
    paths=re.findall(family+r'\S*\s+=>\s+(\S+)',os.environ['TRIAL_LOADED'])
    if not paths or any(not p.startswith(package+'/lib/') for p in paths):
        raise SystemExit('Wrong/mixed payload library on rank')
rank=os.environ['OMPI_COMM_WORLD_RANK']
print(f'TRIAL_RANK rank={rank} host={socket.gethostname()} mpi={mpi} ucx={ucx}',file=__import__('sys').stderr)
PY
unset TRIAL_LOADED TRIAL_COMPONENT
exec "$exe" "$@"
SH
chmod +x "$TRIAL_ROOT/bench/rank-exec.sh"
```

Record `ucx_info -d`, runtime tuning and memlock on all nodes for **both** stacks before timing. UCX transport capability must match; a reference TCP fallback versus full RDMA is a configuration error. Keep bindings, filesystem policy and inputs identical. Inspect Slurm allocation and placement evidence; do not accept oversubscription or a site MPI fallback.

## 4. Run and report the first comparison

After a correctness/placement pilot, use the fixed pair/allocation budgets in 08. For interactive runs in a compute allocation:

```bash
export TRIAL_SCOPE=stack COMPARATORS=reference PAIRS=10
# Use the serial or parallel launch commands in 06 with a fresh RUN_ID.
# For manual paired.py calls, also provide its reference executable:
export COMPARE=reference
export COMPARE_EXECUTABLE="$TRIAL_ROOT/bench/fftw-reference"
# Unset MPI_NP for this serial example and use an allocated CPUSET.
unset MPI_NP
taskset -c "$CPUSET" python3 "$TRIAL_ROOT/bench/paired.py" \
  fftw "$TRIAL_ROOT/bench/fftw-fixed" stack-fft-small 1 1024 50000 1 estimate
unset COMPARE_EXECUTABLE
```

For the batch campaign set `TRIAL_SCOPE=stack`, `RUN_PIE=0`, `CAMPAIGN_COMPARATORS=reference`, `NODE_COUNTS='1 2'`, `RUN_WEAK=0`. The normal workload suite includes startup cases; the initial primary comparison already changes the callers' PIE together with their other controls. PIE-only attribution is deferred. Summaries/CSV label `scope=stack`, identify callers, dependency prefixes and launchers by arm, and retain absolute runtimes, paired changes, means/spread and intervals. Keep allocations separate and report coverage/failures.

For a focused package/control follow-up select `TRIAL_SCOPE=library`; retain full MPI/UCX and full BLAS, build only the missing package variants, then choose workload/comparator entries through 06. Set `RUN_PIE=1` and build 07 callers only when conducting PIE attribution. Removal arms are experimental references, not a proposed production relaxation or an automatic compliance exception.

The first comparison measures the combined trial scope. It does not attribute a change to MPI versus UCX or a particular flag, and it does not establish that all applications/scales are unaffected. Expansion follows the predeclared hypotheses and uncertainty, not a requirement to test every possible combination.
